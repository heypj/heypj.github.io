      Me and Ankita Used to talk about how I had a crush on you and I looked at that one girl in her status and always found her so attractive. This very day, Panda sent me two of your most favorite photos of me. One is the Princep Ghat photo of you with a white churidar, open hair, a small black bindi and a smile which was enough to pause my heart for a bit, along with you in a blue churidar in the walking street.

      She sent you the audio recording. I meant it for you. Glad that you heard. I told her - maybe in an imaginary world I would be singing that to her. Great to know and feel that you are mine and that imaginary world is right in front of me. I was worried how you would react, but you being you, reacted in the best way possible to a song coming from a stranger.

      Finally got the courage to message, to talk, to share, we connected instantly. It took no time to feel home with you. Felt like we were friends for a long time. We talked, talked and talked. You pinged me by yourself. Hello Mr. Responsible. Always one of the most special first messages someone ever sent me over WhatsApp.

      That ping drew so many emotions within me - “vc kre?” I didn’t know what to say, I replied instantly a yes but I was worried that I am at my desk, lights are less, face looks bad, very bad health shape. But that call was like talking to someone over video call, I talk daily. You sent the first Sukoon song. I wrote if it was for me, you replied something unbelievable for Sagnik’s world - “The song sukoon for my sukoon” Someone saying me her sukoon, too big of a compliment. No one in my lifetime ever told me this.

      I was scared. I was worried. I was overwhelmed with emotions. I was stunned. I couldn’t comprehend what to do. How to do it. But somehow I expressed everything I could at that point and told those three words my heart was rushing to tell you. That was the most nervous I was, in recent times. It felt like the world had come to me when you reacted in such a positive way.

It’s not the movie, it’s you being there with me, we kissing and hugging and smiling at each other - that is the part that always lights up my eyes.

			Goodbyes are hard, but that one was a bit too much maybe. When for the first time, I was walking towards the ticket counter, it felt like my world is failing sport, I knows we would met in another 10 days, but it felt I have to run to you, hug you tight, and stay for some time like that, emotions were flowing like stray wind in heart when I hugged you from back. I missed you so badly in every part of the train journey.

You are special, you are a blessing, you are a gift from god to me, you are beautiful in so many ways. <br><br>
			
			Stay by my side always, that is all my heart wishes for. Whatever Comes our way, we will deal, we will handle, we will talk it out, we will sort it out, we will bring it back. Together we can do it. You are one of the most important parts of me now. More to explore. More to travel. More to completing our bucket lists together. Cheers to us, cheers to the relationship, cheers to the small world that we built within us - all the bright places. Wish to grow together, wish to go through good and bad times together, wishing a lifetime togetherness. Touch wood.<br><br>
			
			I love you to the moon and back. Miss you every single day. waiting to stay together for a lifetime. I hope that day comes sooner than ever. With love, Yours,
